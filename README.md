## 📘 Abstract
This thesis applies **Markov Transition Fields (MTF)** to detect and interpret abnormal patterns in battery data.  
By transforming temporal voltage and capacity signals into transition matrices, the method highlights subtle degradation or anomalies that traditional statistical indicators may overlook.  
The results facilitate **microcontroller-based (e.g., Raspberry Pi)** systems for real-time image-based battery health monitoring and anomaly visualization.

## 🧩 Key Contributions
- Implemented **Markov Transition analysis** for battery anomaly detection.  
- Developed visualization pipeline to represent temporal dynamics as MTF images.  
- Integrated results with **Raspberry Pi** for embedded image-based data inspection.
